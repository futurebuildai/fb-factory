# GitHub Actions Netlify PR previews

Same-repository pull requests get prebuilt Netlify previews from GitHub
Actions for the app sites touched by the change. GitHub Actions builds the
pull request revision, uploads the artifact to the canonical Netlify site with
a PR alias, smoke-tests it, and comments the openable URL on the pull request.
Netlify is only the artifact host and CDN for this flow.

Fork pull requests skip the deployment lane because GitHub withholds
deployment secrets from untrusted fork code. The trusted workflow coordinates
the preview from the base revision, while a separate build job checks out the
PR revision without deployment credentials. The upload job checks out only the
trusted base revision, builds its trusted Functions, and receives the PR's
static artifact. PR-controlled Functions are never deployed.

Preview deploys do not create an isolated database. Before each GitHub Actions
upload, the workflow copies the production PostgreSQL URL from the matching
`NETLIFY_PREVIEW_DATABASE_URL_<TEMPLATE>` GitHub secret into the
`branch-deploy` context used by the aliased prebuilt upload, and the deployed
preview smoke check requires the database and schema to be healthy. Those secrets mirror the matching local
`templates/<template>/.env` `DATABASE_URL`; `chat` uses the production Netlify
database because its local template has no database URL. Treat every preview as
non-isolated and unsafe to write. Only database variables are copied; other
provider credentials remain managed by the Netlify site. The workflow below also
cleans up branch resources left by the former isolation flow.

## How it works

1. **PR opened/updated** - no Neon branch or Netlify database override is
   created. GitHub Actions builds the changed app sites and publishes PR
   aliases.

2. **Preview URL** - the workflow smoke-tests each uploaded deploy and adds a
   per-app link to the pull request.

3. **PR closed** - the workflow deletes any matching
   `GitHub Actions PR preview #*` Netlify deploys. The separate legacy cleanup
   workflow removes any leftover `preview-schema-only/pr-*` or `preview/pr-*`
   Neon branches and old branch-scoped `DATABASE_URL` overrides.

`@agent-native/core` uses PostgreSQL through `DATABASE_URL`.
The Netlify specifics live in the workflow and each template's `netlify.toml`.
Every canonical app site in `scripts/netlify-production-sites.json`, including
Factory, can receive an artifact-only PR alias.

## Preview access requirements

Keep public preview access gated with Netlify team login, SSO, or an equivalent
visitor gate, and do not use previews for workflows that can create real
external side effects.

## Required GitHub secrets

| Secret                                    | Where to get it                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEON_API_KEY`                            | Neon dashboard → Account → API Keys                                                              |
| `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`                      | Netlify User Settings → Personal Access Token                                                    |
| `NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_ID`                      | Netlify team settings → Team ID                                                                  |
| `NETLIFY_PREVIEW_DATABASE_URL_<TEMPLATE>` | Matching production `templates/<template>/.env` URL; `CHAT` uses the production Netlify database |

## Restoring production env vars

Production template secrets are not managed by the PR preview workflow. If a
Netlify project loses its env vars during a migration, restore them from the
local ignored template env files:

```bash
pnpm sync:netlify-env -- --template clips
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=... NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_ID=... pnpm sync:netlify-env -- --template clips --write
```

The script is dry-run by default, logs key names only, writes the production
context, and marks real secrets as Netlify secret values while leaving public
deployment metadata plain so Netlify's secret scanner does not block deploys.
It merges `templates/<name>/.env` and `templates/<name>/.env.local` because
some deploy-relevant auth keys, such as `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, currently live in
`.env.local`. Pass `--all` to restore every known template site.

## Site ↔ Neon project mapping

Defined in the workflow's matrix. Update it when adding a new hosted template.

## Schema changes

`drizzle-kit push` is **not** run in any build (removed after it caused
production data loss — see PR #252). Schema evolution uses `runMigrations`
in each template's `server/plugins/db.ts` — additive SQL only
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`).

## Follow-ups

- **FB Factory Plans DNS/TLS.** The Plans Neon project and Netlify site are
  configured and included in the preview-branch workflows. To complete the
  public cutover, `plan.agent-native.com` should resolve as a DNS-only CNAME to
  `agent-native-plan.netlify.app`; then provision/verify TLS in Netlify.

- **PR visual recap publishing.** PR automation can publish org-gated visual
  recap plans to the hosted Plans app by default when `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN`
  contains the publish token. Set `PLAN_RECAP_APP_URL` only for a self-hosted
  Plans app. Recap links are review aids; they do not replace the GitHub diff
  review.

- **Preview-only actions.** Actions that reach outside the DB (send email,
  charge a card, post to Slack) need their own preview-vs-prod gating so
  preview deploys don't trigger real-world side effects.
